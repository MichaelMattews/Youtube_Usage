Exploring My Youtube Usage

The first step in dealing with addiction is recognizing it. For me, YouTube has been mainly for fun and learning. I’ve learned a lot from it, especially when studying for exams. It’s also a great place for music and entertainment. But sometimes, I get carried away and spend a lot of time on it, which can be hard to break away from.

I was searching for a one-of-a-kind dataset to enhance my data analysis project for my portfolio, and I believe nothing is more unique than my personal YouTube history. By analyzing my history data I will try to minimize my usage of youtube and only use it when I need it.

Disclaimer: While I continue learning and improve in Python, I often research and explore ways to enhance my skills. During my internship, I discovered that even experienced data engineers use search engines when they encounter difficulties. I’m open about this, and I’ll share the references I use for learning.

Ensuring data cleanliness is crucial for accurate insights in data analysis. This dataset was obtained from Google Takeout.
